        <strong>Hello! My name is Krishna (he/him).</strong>
        <p>I'm a statistics and data science major looking to minor in the CTD program. I'm originally from California, however having lived in Boulder for almost 10 years I definitely consider this as home.</p>
        <p>In taking this course I hope to better understand how websites function, particularly how JavaScript elements interact with HTML code.</p>
